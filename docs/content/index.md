# Perstack: Expert Stack for Agent-first Development

Perstack is a package manager and runtime for agent-first development.
Define modular micro-agents as Experts in TOML, publish them to a registry, and compose them like npm packages.

**Perstack isn't another agent framework — it's npm/npx for agents.**

## Key Features

- **Agent-first development toolkit**
  - Declarative Expert definitions as modular micro-agents
  - Dependency management for composing Experts
  - Public registry for reusing Experts instead of rebuilding them
- **Sandbox-ready runtime**
  - Secure execution designed for sandbox integration
  - Observable, event-driven architecture
  - Reproducible, checkpoint-based history

## Why Perstack?

AI agent developers struggle with:
- Complex, monolithic agent apps
- Little to no reusability
- No dependency management
- Context windows that explode at scale

Perstack fixes these with proven software engineering principles:
- **Isolation** — clear separation of concerns per Expert
- **Observability** — every step is visible and traceable
- **Reusability** — Experts compose declaratively through the runtime

## Expert Stack

Perstack provides **Expert Stack**:
- **Experts** — modular micro-agents
- **Runtime** — executes Experts
- **Registry** — shares Experts
- **Sandbox Integration** — safe production execution

> [!NOTE]
> The name "Perstack" combines the Latin word "perītus" (expert) and "stack".
