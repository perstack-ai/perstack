# Workspace

The workspace is the isolated directory where Experts execute. All file operations are confined to this directory.

## Default workspace

By default, the current directory becomes the workspace:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
npx perstack run my-expert "query"
# Workspace: /path/to/my-project
```

## Security

Workspace isolation prevents Experts from accessing unintended files.

**Allowed:**
- Read/write files within the workspace
- Create/delete directories within the workspace
- Relative and absolute paths (resolved within workspace)

**Blocked:**
- Access outside the workspace
- Symlink escape attempts
- Path traversal (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Direct access to `perstack/` directory

These restrictions ensure Experts can only affect their designated environment.

## Data exchange between Experts

Delegated Experts don't share LLM context. They exchange data through workspace files:

```toml
[experts."coordinator"]
instruction = """
1. Delegate to researcher to gather information
2. Read the report from ./reports/research.md
3. Summarize findings
"""
delegates = ["researcher"]

[experts."researcher"]
instruction = "Research the topic and save to ./reports/research.md"
```

Benefits:
- **Token efficiency** — no context duplication
- **Independence** — each Expert runs with clean context
- **Explicit data flow** — files make data exchange visible

## Runtime data

The runtime stores execution history in `perstack/runs/` within the workspace. This directory is managed automatically — see [Runtime](/understanding-perstack/runtime#the-perstack-directory) for details.
