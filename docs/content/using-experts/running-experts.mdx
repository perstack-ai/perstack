# Running Experts

Perstack provides two commands for running Experts: `start` and `run`.

## `start` vs `run`

- `perstack start` — **Interactive**. A workbench for defining and testing Experts.
- `perstack run` — **Headless**. For production, automation, and scripting.

Both commands share the same options and execution behavior.

## `perstack start`

```bash
npx perstack start my-expert "query"
```

Opens a text-based UI for iterating on Expert definitions:
- Watch execution in real-time
- Inspect tool calls and results
- Browse checkpoint history
- Continue with follow-up queries

Use `perstack start` while developing — refine your Expert's instruction until it behaves as expected.

## `perstack run`

```bash
npx perstack run my-expert "query"
```

Outputs JSON events to stdout. Each line is a JSON object representing an execution event.

Each invocation creates a new **Job** containing one or more **Runs**. See [State Management](/using-experts/state-management) for details on the execution hierarchy.

Use `perstack run` for:
- Production deployments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automation scripts

## Running registry Experts

Run Experts from the registry using scoped names:

```bash
npx perstack start tic-tac-toe "Let's play!"
npx perstack start @org/my-expert@1.0.0 "query"
```

## Common options

```bash
npx perstack start my-expert "query" \
  --provider anthropic \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-5 \
  --max-steps 50
```

For the complete list of options, see [CLI Reference](/references/cli).
