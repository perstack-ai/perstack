# Error Handling

Perstack is designed to recover from errors automatically when possible. Most errors are fed back to the LLM for self-correction rather than crashing the run.

## How errors are handled

| Error type | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Tool/MCP errors | Fed back to LLM — it can retry or try a different approach |
| LLM generation errors | Automatic retry with error context |
| Fatal errors | Run stops with `stoppedByError` |

This design lets the LLM handle transient failures (network issues, rate limits, invalid tool arguments) without human intervention.

## Stop reasons

A Run ends with one of these checkpoint statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `completed` | LLM called `attemptCompletion` with no remaining todos — task done |
| `stoppedByExceededMaxSteps` | Job's `maxSteps` limit reached |
| `stoppedByInteractiveTool` | Waiting for user input (Coordinator only) |
| `stoppedByDelegate` | Waiting for delegate Expert |
| `stoppedByError` | Unrecoverable error |

When a Run stops with `stoppedByExceededMaxSteps`, you can resume from the last checkpoint. See [State Management](/using-experts/state-management).

## Delegation errors

When a Delegated Expert fails, the Job continues running. The error is returned to the Coordinator as the delegation result:

| Delegate outcome | Job behavior | Coordinator receives |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Success | Continues | Run result (natural language) |
| Failure | Continues | Error message |

The Coordinator can then decide to:
- Retry the delegation
- Try a different delegate
- Handle the error gracefully
- Give up and report to the user

This design ensures a single delegate failure doesn't crash the entire Job.

## Events for monitoring

Use `errorRun` events to monitor failures:

```bash
npx perstack run my-expert "query" | jq 'select(.type == "errorRun")'
```

For programmatic access:

```typescript
import { run } from "@perstack/runtime"

await run(params, {
  eventListener: (event) => {
    if (event.type === "errorRun") {
      // Log, alert, or handle the error
    }
  }
})
```

## Common issues

**MCP server not starting**: Check that `requiredEnv` variables are set and the command is correct.

**Tool call failures**: The LLM receives the error and usually retries. If failures persist, check the tool's input requirements.

**Rate limits**: The runtime retries automatically. For high-volume usage, configure provider rate limits or add delays.
