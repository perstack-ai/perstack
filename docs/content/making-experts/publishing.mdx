# Publishing Experts

Share your Experts with the community by publishing them to the Perstack Registry.

## Before publishing

Ensure your Expert is ready:

1. **Clear description** — tells other Experts (and humans) what this Expert does and how to use it
2. **Tested locally** — run it with various queries to verify behavior
3. **Minimal skills** — only include skills the Expert actually needs
4. **Version-ready** — follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) for versioning

## Publishing via CLI

Use the `perstack publish` command to publish Experts from your `perstack.toml`:

```bash
# Publish a specific Expert
npx perstack publish my-expert

# Interactive selection (if multiple Experts defined)
npx perstack publish

# Validate without publishing
npx perstack publish my-expert --dry-run
```

### Authentication

Add your API key to `.env`:

```bash
PERSTACK_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Obtain API keys from your organization dashboard.

## Versioning

The Registry uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

| Change type | Version bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Breaking changes | MAJOR | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 |
| New features (backward compatible) | MINOR | 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 |
| Bug fixes | PATCH | 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 |

### Write-once immutability

Once a version is published, it **cannot be changed**. This guarantees:
- Dependent Experts always get the same definition
- No supply chain attacks via version tampering
- Reproducible builds

To fix a bug, publish a new version.

## Tags

Tags are mutable pointers to versions:

```bash
npx perstack run @your-org/your-expert@latest "query"
npx perstack run @your-org/your-expert@stable "query"
```

- `latest` — automatically updated on each publish
- Custom tags (e.g., `stable`, `beta`) — manually managed

### Managing tags via CLI

Use the `perstack tag` command to add or update tags:

```bash
# Interactive wizard (select Expert and version)
npx perstack tag

# Add tags to a specific version
npx perstack tag my-expert@1.0.0 stable

# Multiple tags
npx perstack tag my-expert@1.0.0 stable production
```

## Scoped names

Expert names are scoped by organization:

```
@{organization}/{expert-name}
```

- Organization must be registered on the Platform
- Expert names: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens

## Status management

Expert versions have three status levels:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `available` | Normal operation (default) |
| `deprecated` | Warns users, still works |
| `disabled` | Prevents new dependencies |

### Managing status via CLI

Use the `perstack status` command to change version status:

```bash
# Interactive wizard (select Expert and version)
npx perstack status

# Deprecate a version
npx perstack status my-expert@1.0.0 deprecated

# Disable a version
npx perstack status my-expert@1.0.0 disabled
```

### Status transitions

- `available` → `deprecated` ✓
- `available` → `disabled` ✓
- `deprecated` → `disabled` ✓
- `deprecated` → `available` ✗ (cannot revert)
- `disabled` → any ✗ (terminal state)

Versions with active dependents cannot be deleted. Use deprecation to signal migration.

## Unpublishing

Remove a version from the registry:

```bash
# Interactive wizard (select Expert and version)
npx perstack unpublish

# Direct unpublish with confirmation
npx perstack unpublish my-expert@1.0.0 --force
```

The `--force` flag is required when using CLI mode.
